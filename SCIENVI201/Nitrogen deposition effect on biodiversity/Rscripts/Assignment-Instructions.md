Assignment Instruction
================

These assignment instructions serve you as a guide in completing your
original assignment. Here, I will walk you step by step through an
example of the assignment. Once you complete this, you can start with
your own variation of the assignment. Creativity is very welcome. In
your version of the assignment you choose:

    - species you want to study
    - year (Nitrogen deposition and species occurences)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
