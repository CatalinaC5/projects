  Nitrogen deposition is one of the main causes of current biodiversity decline (Payne, et a., 2013). This is mainly due to highly intesified agricultural practices which are very common, here, in the Netherlands. Therefore, environmentalists and ecologists have had numerous debates in recent years on how to analyse and tackle this biodiversity decline due to Nitrogen. Which species are harmed and might some even benefit? As an ecologist, you need to know what is the species distribution and how it correlates with past, current and future Nitrogen deposition to be able to draw the right conclusion and action plans for species protection. In this assignment you will work with external source of species occurences, will correlate these to Nitrogen deposition in the Netherlands and perform statistical test to see what relationship there is between Nitrogen deposition and the occurences of a chosen species.
  
  
  ## DATA
  
  The organisms occurrences can be directly downloaded in a csv file from gbif.com.
  The nitrogen deposition in the Netherlands can be downloaded from RIVM website: https://www.rivm.nl/gcn-gdn-kaarten/depositiekaarten/cijfers-achter-depositiekaarten/gdn-depositiebestanden-achterliggende-jaren. 
  
  ## SKILLS
  While completing this project a student can develop multiple R skills as well as practice performing research with previously gathered data from an external source.
  
  Skills practice:
  
  
          -  Obtaining and importing data from an online source to R
          -  Filtering and adjusting data to reach a set of desired information only
          -  Visualization of species occurences and Nitrogen deposition levels
          -  Visualization of graphs in R
          -  Performing statistical test
  
 
  ## RESEARCH FOCUS
  What is the relationship between species occurences and Nitrogen deposition levels.
