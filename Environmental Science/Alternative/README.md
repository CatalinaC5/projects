# Alternative 
  Distribution of organisms in relation to Nitrogen pollution in the Netherlands
  
  ## DATA
  
  ## SKILLS
  While completing this project a student can develop multiple R skills as well as practice performing research with previously gathered data from an external source.
  
  Skills practice:
  
  
          -  Obtaining and importing data from an online source to R
          -  Filtering and adjusting data to reach a set of desired information only
          -  Visualization of species occurences on a map (perhaps inclusion of map software QGIS)
          -  Visualizationof graphs in R
          -  performing statistical test
