# An overview of the STOWA project

  In this set of small projects, we aim to analyse the distribution of various aquatic organisms in relation to water pollution in the Netherlands.
  
  The dutch foundation for Applied water research (STOWA) - Limnodata Neerlandica - offers occurences data on the aquatic organisms in the Netherlands in the aim of 
  monitoring the water quality. The observations are available for phytoplankton, diatoms, plants, macro invertebrates and fish. The temporal scale of the dataset is over 
  30 years (1980 - 2012).
  The data is retrieved from publicly available soruce gbif.org.
  
  The Waterbase Rivers dataset is sourced from European Environmental Agency (https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/92-9167-001-4/page014.html) and contains information 
  about the nutritious and hazardous substances content of European rivers. The temporal scale of the dataset is ranging from 1970s to 2012.
