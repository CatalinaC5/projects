These assignment instructions serve you as a guide in completing your original assignment. Here, I will walk you step by step through an example of the assignment. Once you complete this, you can start with your own variation of the assignment. Creativity is very welcome. 
In your version of the assignment you choose:

    - species you want to study
    - year (Nitrogen deposition and species occurences)

### The correlation between Chaffinch, Fringilla coelebs, and Nitrogen deposition levels in the Netherlands

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(readr)
library(tidymodels)
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
